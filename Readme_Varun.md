## Week 1
### Class 1

* Discussed and agreed up on a final project -  F1 race data.
* Analysed API vs CSV data at a high level and decided to go with csv dataset.  
* Decided on each member's roles. 
* Considered an unsupervised machine learning model to classify the drivers.
* Discussed with instructor and TAâ€™s about project goal and deliverables.  

### Class 2
* Practised Github branches and main. 
* Resolved merge conflicts. 
* Discussed about Driver classification from available data
* Database diagram and tables
* Agreed on Visualisation tool - Tableau 

## Week 2
### Class 1
* Discussed about ETL 
* AWS server created and data imported.
* Applied unsupervised algorithms (K-Means and Hierarchical clustering) and clustered the data.
* Discussed about data size and disadvantages of inner join. 
* Planned to implement outer join to avoid data loss. 
* Decided to meet up midweek to work in google colab that pulls directly from aws server. 

## Week 3:
Discussed about unsupervised machine learning models to classify Formula One drivers based on various features of driver, constructor, and race data. The team utilized Google Colab as the primary platform for developing and implementing the models, and employed K-means and Hierarchal Clustering Analysis (HCA) algorithms to cluster the data and uncover patterns based on driver performance and race results.

## Week 4:
Tried supervised ML models. The models were Linear Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest Regressor, and Random Forest Classifier. From the models the team experimented with different parameters for each model to discover the best results. The results explained that the Neural Network Classifier had the highest precision score of 0.76 while Linear regression had the lowest precision score of 0.52. The precision scores for Random Forest Regressor and Random Forest Classifier were 0.48 and 0.52. It should be noted that the data used left out 2022 data so that we could then discover if the models could predict some 2022 results.
