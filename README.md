Final group project for UC Berkeley Data Bootcamp. Develop a machine learning model with a database and a interactive visual dashboard. 

# Jacob's Comments from week 1
>Looks like our F1 data folder from Kaggle is a strong and substantial source.  Additionally, we have some interesting data on tires, weather, etc. from an API that will be a little harder to wrangle.  For now, we discussed looking into a clustering classification approach to see if there are "types" of drivers to be identified. This could, in turn, become a useful label in interactive dashboarding of other aspects- we'll see how it works out first.  We also discussed getting the main Kaggle folder of csv's all organized into a relational diagram and a set of tables in a postgres database for access and queries.  We spent some time working out our use of branches and repository protocols.
