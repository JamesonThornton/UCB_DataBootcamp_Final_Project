# My notes for consideration of progress and awareness of group motion.

## Week 1
>Class 1.  
* Decided to go with F1 data. 
* Decided on some functional foci/roles for each.  
* Decided to consider an unsupervised machine learning model to cluster drivers.
>Class 2. 
* Worked out issues with Github branch practices
* Agreed to go foward with simplifying dataset to usable/meaninful columns in tables with driverId in them
* Planned to move to Tabelau visualization
>Looking forward.
* Preparing for deeper ETL process in week 2 to get solid merged df for ml model.
